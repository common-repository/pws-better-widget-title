== Description ==
### PWS Better Widget Title

[PWS Better Widget Title](https://www.pathwisesolutions.com) is a little utility that only displays the part of the widget title outside of square brackets, "[]" on the front end of the site.

This allows you to add details relevant to the widget that are visible in the backend, without them appearing on the user view of the widget.

For instance:
* Widget Title: Contact [Button Version] A Person – 'Contact A Person' will show on the front end. 'Button version' will not show.
* Widget Title: [Contact A Person] – Nothing will show on the front end.
* Widget Title: Contact [A Person] – 'Contact' will show on the front end. A Person will not show.
* Widget Title: Contact [A] Support [Person] – 'Contact Support' will show on the front end.
* Widget Title: [Contact A] Support [Person] – 'Support' will show on the front end.
